# fanciful-plugin
The [Fanciful](http://github.com/mkremins/fanciful) chat message formatting library for Bukkit plugins, packaged as a standalone Bukkit plugin for easier consumption as part of a non-Maven plugin development workflow.

## Installation
Add the Fanciful plugin to your plugin's runtime dependencies in your `plugin.yml`.

```yaml
depend: [Fanciful]
```

Instruct server administrators who install your plugin to also install `fanciful-plugin.jar` (by adding it to the server's `/plugins` directory like any other plugin).

## Usage
Same as Fanciful itself.

## License
[MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), same as Fanciful itself.
